# Phil's Helpful Functions
by Phil Enock, written 2011-2014

## Available, but not exactly documented
These functions are all kind of cool in their own way, and I've used them a lot in my data projects.

I wanted to make them available on GitHub for sharing purposes.

I don't have time to document them all, though. The dependencies on many libraries might make it inconvenient for use.

I've shared a small subset of the functions on https://github.com/penock/phil-on-learning-r-guide so you can head there for more publicly usable ones (that don't have library dependencies).

## Files in this repository
The key file here is: **ph.main.R**

If you source that, it will source the other files (provided you set the path constant correctly up top).
